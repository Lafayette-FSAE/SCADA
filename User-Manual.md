# Introduction and Purpose

SCADA is an acronym for Supervisory Control And Data Aquisition. It is a term borrowed from industrial control applications, where a single server is often used to oversee large industrial plants such as oil refineries and assembly lines. In general, SCADA systems have three functions, they aquire data from the network of sensors connected to the plant, send control signals to the plant's other subsystems, and provide an interface for humans to interact with the plant by viewing aggregated data and issueing commands.

The Lafayette FSAE team has been working to develop a SCADA system that can be fully integrated into its electric vehichle, with the goal of performing all of the above three functions both during normal operation and throughout the various testing and maintenacne procedures that it will undergo. At times in the past, this system has been referred to as VSCADA, short for Vehichle SCADA, to distinguish it from the industrial systems described above, but for brevity this document will refer to it simply as SCADA.
